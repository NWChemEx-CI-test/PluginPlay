Simulation Development Environment
==================================

Getting Started with the SDE
----------------------------

Topics in this section are targeted at users who want to run the SDE and 
possibly dynamically influence the control flow.

- [Terminology](dox/terminology.md) details what SDE specific terms mean
- [Overview](dox/overview.md) provides a high-level overview of the SDE
- [User Workflow](dox/workflow.md) details a typical workflow
- [App Workflow](dox/AppFlow.md) details the basics of running an app as well as
  how to write simple "lambda apps"

Extending the SDE
-----------------

Topics in this section are meant for users who want to write apps and/or make 
their libraries discoverable/usable with the SDE, but don't care about the 
internals of the SDE more than they need to. 

- [Advanced App Workflow](dox/AdvancedAppFlow.md) details the app lifecycle in
  much greater detail to ensure users can get the most out of their apps
- [Setting Parameters](dox/parameters.md) details the types of parameters 
  available and the features provided by the Parameters class
  
Understanding the SDE
---------------------

Topics in this section are meant for users who want to understand how the SDE
works in more detail.

- [Running an App](dox/RunningAnApp.md) details what happens when a user 
  calls `sde.run`
- [Cache Workflow]() details how the SDE and apps interact with the cache
