Overview of SDE
===============

SDE ultimately is a framework (in the computer science sense) for 
developing computational chemistry codes.  By itself SDE is only capable of 
performing the most mundane of tasks; however, SDE is designed to be easily 
extendable by developing *apps* (also commonly called modules or plugins) for 
it.  This is similar to how most cell phone operating systems and internet 
browsers work, namely users can extend the functionality of the program by 
installing (or even developing) new plugins.  This page focuses on providing 
high-level details regarding the functionality of the SDE as well as its 
interactions with apps.

App Types

SDE currently sees the need to distinguish among apps that perform the following
tasks:

Add list of API types after more thought.
